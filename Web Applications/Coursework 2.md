### AB NATARAJ
Hard to understand. There might be some errors in the code. The example chosen to create models and relationships is not relevant to a blog app.

### LORENZO LABARTA ARILLA
The code is hard to understand. The naming conventions are not clear. And the example models created don't seem to relevant to a blog application. But the implementation of the models is done properly.

### ILLIA LOBACHEVSKYY
Model definition files are not included. Except for that, everything else is good. Code follows good naming conventions and is easy to understand. There exists some sort of data relationship but it's not clear what it is as there are no model definition files included.
