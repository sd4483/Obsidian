- They managed to show some clear distinctions between BBOB functions and in atleast a few crashworthiness problem instances when evaluation ELA features.
- Despite some limitations mentioned above to the methodologies used, they managed to show some clear distinctions between the BBOB functions and crashworthiness problem instances for computation of ELA features. To what extent these disctinctions hold up to multi-objective and constrained problems has to be seen if they continue with the research.
- The process of selecting the ELA features for computation is well done. Instead of  computing all the ELA features which could have significantly increased the computational cost of the overall experiment, they only chose the features which could provide useful information about the problem.
- The process they used for feature selection by removing highly correlated features is a good thing, as having computational data of two highly correlated features could lead to more noise when doing clustering.
