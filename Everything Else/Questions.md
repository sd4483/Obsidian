- I need a realistic understanding of how the experience could be like. How often is the interaction with supervisors going to be, what could be some challenges.
- As a person who have never done something like this before, what advise would you give to that person. 
- It says there is an integrated masters component. I'm currently doing my masters in Advanced Comp. Science. If I were to be selected, do I need to pursue another masters degree?
- I have intermediated programming skills. I can write some basic programs and solve some problems but I wouldn't say I'm fully knowledgable of writing a complex program or solving a complex challenge. But I'm eager to learn and willing to put in the time. 
- Although I lack a bit in my programming skills I believe I have good design thinking skills. I try to think of simplified and personalised solutions to everyday problems. I have 4 years of professional experience working as a IT & Marketing representative for an SME in Singapore. I'm very enthusiastic about technology and try to keep up with the latest trends as much as I can. 
- This is what I understood from the information given:
	- The research is about improving human interactions through the use of data and intelligence (AI) driven systems. 

Hi Dr. Simon, 

I went through the information on the page. These are some questions I have:

- I got a high level idea of what the research is about. Can you give me a practical example or understanding of the research like maybe one project or aspect of the research. 

- As a person who has never done something like this before, I need a realistic understanding of how the experience could be like. How often is the interaction with supervisors going to be, what could be some challenges, etc.

- It's mentioned on the information page that there is an integrated masters component. I'm currently doing my masters in Advanced Comp. Science. Hypothetically, If I were to be selected, do I need to pursue another masters degree?

- **Just to give you some context about me:**

- I have intermediated programming skills. I can write some basic programs and solve some problems but I wouldn't say I'm fully knowledgable of writing a complex program or solving a complex challenge. But I'm eager to learn and willing to put in the time. Do you think I would be still be an eligible candidate?

- Although I lack a bit in my programming skills I believe I have good design thinking skills. I try to think of simplified and personalised solutions to everyday problems. I have 4 years of professional experience working as a IT & Marketing representative for an SME in Singapore. I'm very enthusiastic about technology and try to keep up with the latest trends as much as I can. 

- The big question I have is, I have interest in the topic and the area of research. But I could say the same thing about various other topics like blockchain, quantum computing, etc. PhD is a long commitment, how can I validate with myself whether this would be something that I can commit to for the long term and complete it. Can you provide some insights from your experience particulary with regards how you tackled with self-doubt or things like that i.e if you experienced something like that.

I apologise for the long email. If you think this questions could be answered better in person, please do let me know when you are avialable for an appointment.

Thank you
