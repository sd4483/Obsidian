==Commodity==: Commodities are fungible (replacable by another identical item), transferrable, and somewhat scarce.

==Digital Commodities==: Digital commodities are transferred electronically.

==Decentralised==: No single party controls creation, allocation, or transfer of the commodity

==BITCOIN==: Decentralised Digital Commodity

>[!success] BITCOIN: Decentralised Digital Commodity

==How it works:==
1. Each user has a local agent, named bitcoind
2. Agent has a GUI, manages the protocol and holds your coinds
3. Agents talk to each other over the internet
4. Users send payments to each other by giving address and value to agent
5. Addresses are cryptographic identifier of a public key which looks like 1K2CcFkW3eFdACyZHDLsSSALHSh23ads
6. Agent sends signed messages to other agents, transferring coins
7. Receiving user's agent informs them upon receipt of payment

==What's wrong with a centralised curreny?==
- Central bank could print new money whenever they want which would cause inflation and unpredictability in the total flow of money.
- Security and safety is in the hands of whoever is in the control of the money which could lead to bad actors.
- Failure of the central authority (goverment) could lead to failure of the entire nation

==Goals of decentralisation==
- Security depends upon on math, rather than goodwill of the people
- No single person or entity controls the currency supply
- Power/control of the currency is spread among many users using and contributing to the currency
- Failure of a single user or entity doesn't fail the entire currency
- Decentralisation could instill new confidence and trust in the currecny for users.
