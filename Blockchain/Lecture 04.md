Pay to script hash

Requires that in order to unlock it, you need to provide a script with hash

==Soft fork== - when a transaction is accepted by a new implementation, it is also accepted by a old implementation

take a new element -> hash it -> run it as a program (something like that)

locking <-> unlocking (not clear)
