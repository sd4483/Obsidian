### What

**Decisions**: Boolean expressions in the program
<u>Example</u>: `a == b && a != c`

**Conditions**: Atomic boolean subexpressions of a decision
<u>Example</u>: Condition one: `a == b` Condition two: `a != c`

##### Condition Coverage

Checks whether every condition has taken every possible value at least once.

##### Decision Coverage

Checks whether every decision has taken every possible value at least once.

##### Condition/Decision Coverage

Checks whether every condition has taken every possible value and every decision has taken every possible value at least once.

### Why

For testing boolean conditions in the program.
