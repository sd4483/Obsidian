A coverage criterion is only as good as its weakest test suite.

C0 -> Every ==reachable node of G== is contained in the execution path of some test input in T (Also called statement coverage)

C1 -> Every ==reachable edge of G== is contained in the execution path of some test input in T. (Also called branch coverage)
