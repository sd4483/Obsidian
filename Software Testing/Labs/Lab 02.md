##### Task 02

if (c.age <= 18 | (c.age <= 21 & c.isStudent))

age = 21
student = T

age = 22
student = F

if (c.isStudent & c.age > 21)

if (c.isPremiumMember & c.age > 18)

if (c.isPensioner | c.age >= 65)


##### Task 03

c.age <= 18  - 18 | 17
c.age <= 21 -  19 | 21
c.isStudent - T | F
c.isPremiumMember - T | F
c.isPensioner - T | F
