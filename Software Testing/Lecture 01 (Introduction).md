#### How software is developed (steps involved):
1. **==Requirements gathering==**
	- Sometimes the requirements are clearly listed down which is not usually the case.
	- Sometimes there's only a business objective and requirements have to be deduced or gathered from the objectives.
2. **==Specifications==**
	- The requirements are converted into formal specifications so that requirements can be more precise and can be implemented and verified.
3. **==Implementation==**
	- This is where we actually implement the specification i.e. coding of the software or building the actual product
4. **==Verification==**
	- This is where we check whether the implementation meets the specification.
5. Validation

**A simple example:**
1. **==Requirment:==** 'Compute the square root of a non-negative number.'
2. **==Specification:==** 'Given a double x>=0 compute a double y>=0 such that y^2 = x.'
	- That's the definition of a square root.
	- We use double (64 bit floating point number) cos sometimes square root of a number is not an integer.
