#### How software is developed (steps involved):
1. **==Requirements gathering==**
	- Sometimes the requirements are clearly listed down which is not usually the case.
	- Sometimes there's only a business objective and requirements have to be deduced or gathered from the objectives.
2. **==Specifications==**
	- The requirements are converted into formal specifications so that requirements can be more precise and can be implemented and verified.
3. **==Implementation==**
	- This is where we actually implement the specification i.e. coding of the software or building the actual product
4. **==Verification==**
	- This is where we check whether the implementation meets the specification.
5. Validation

**A simple example:**
1. **==Requirment:==** 'Compute the square root of a non-negative number.'
2. **==Specification:==** 'Given a double x>=0 compute a double y>=0 such that y^2 = x.'
	- That's the definition of a square root.
	- We use double (64 bit floating point number) cos sometimes square root of a number is not an integer.
3. **==Implementation==**
	package square_root;

	public class SquareRoot {
	
	public static double squareRoot(double x) {
	
	double guess = x;
	
	double previousGuess;
	
	do {
	
	previousGuess = guess;
	
	guess = 0.5 * (guess + x/guess);
	
	} while (previousGuess != guess);
	
	return guess;
	
	}
	
	public static boolean testSquareRoot(double x) {
	
	double squareRootx = squareRoot(x);
	
	return squareRootx >= 0 && squareRootx * squareRootx == x;
	
	}
	
	}
1. Verification

```Java
package square_root;

public class SquareRoot {

public static double squareRoot(double x) {

double guess = x;

double previousGuess;

do {

previousGuess = guess;

guess = 0.5 * (guess + x/guess);

} while (previousGuess != guess);

return guess;

}

public static boolean testSquareRoot(double x) {

double squareRootx = squareRoot(x);

return squareRootx >= 0 && squareRootx * squareRootx == x;

}

}
```

```Java
package square_root;

public class SquareRoot {
	public static double squareRoot(double x) {
		double guess = x;
		double previousGuess;
		
		do {
			previousGuess = guess;
			guess = 0.5 * (guess + x/guess);
		} while (previousGuess != guess);
		
		return guess;
	}
	
	public static boolean testSquareRoot(double x) {
		double squareRootx = squareRoot(x);
		return squareRootx >= 0 && squareRootx * squareRootx == x;
	}
}
```
