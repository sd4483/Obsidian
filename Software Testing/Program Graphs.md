## What
Graphs have vertices(V) and edges(E).

Vertices are connected using directional arrows which represent edges.

Vertices (V) and Edges (E) can be thought of as individual sets and the graph as a pair set of (V,E).

All the graphs considered in this module are finite (meaning they all end). Not sure if there are inifinite graphs.

Program graphs are just graphs that represent the control flow of a program.

Each simple program statement is considered a vertex/node (numbers) and the connection or flow from one statement to another is represented using edges(arrows).

## Why

Any program flow can be represented using a graph. It will help us visualise the program and its flow. It can also help us find any infeasible paths in the program that no input can reach.

## How

**Consider a simple program:**

```Java
public int foo(int x, int y)
{
	for (int i=0; i<y; i++)
	{
		x = bar(x);
	}
	if (x == y)
	{
		y = x + y;
		return baz(x, y, y);
	}
	else if (x > y)
	{
		x = x - y;
		return baz(y, x, x);
	}
	else
	{
		return 23;
	}
}
```

**The program graph for the above program:**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
	id1((1)) --> id3((3)) --> id5((5)) --> id4((4))
	id3 --> id7((7)) --> id9((9)) --> id10((10))
	id4 --> id3
	id7 --> id12((12)) --> id14((14)) --> id15((15))
	id12 --> id17((17)) --> id19((19))
```
The parantheses / opening and closing brackets are not considered as part of the graph. 

The return statement is usually the end of the graph unless the graph has a recursive statement.

Loops are represented by adding an arrow back to the statement where the loop started from.

In a `for loop`, the arrow is added back from the loop exit condition, in the example above, loop exit condition would be `i < y`, so an arrow is added back from there to the beginning of the loop. In the example, the exit condition is considered as statement 4.
