## What
Graphs have vertices(V) and edges(E).
Vertices are connected using directional arrows which represent edges.
Vertices (V) and Edges (E) can be thought of as individual sets and the graph as a pair set of (V,E).
All the graphs considered in this module are finite (meaning they all end). Not sure if there are inifinite graphs.
Program graphs are just graphs that represent the control flow of a program.
## Why
Any program flow can be represented using a graph.
